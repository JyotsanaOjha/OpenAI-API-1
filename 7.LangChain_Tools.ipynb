    "**LangChain Tools** are like specialized apps for your LLM. They are tiny code modules that allow it to access information and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "These **tools connect your LLM** to search engines, databases, APIs, and more, expanding its knowledge and capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools are essentially functions that agents can use to interact with the outside world. These can range from general utilities, such as a math calculator or a search function, to other chains or even other agents. Use-case examples: if our AI needs real-time weather updates / search Wikipedia / translate languages..... etc.. It can use these tools to get the job done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of some useful tools:\n",
    "1)PythonREPLTool: This tool provides a Python REPL environment within LangChain allowing the agent to execute Python code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Search tools(Google Search, DuckDuckGo, Tavily AI) Tavily AI is optimized for LLMs and provides an API for AI developers"
